  - Rating 
  - Author and the author-image

Allows to edit the Details of the Blog-Post. Buttons to:

------

### +New-Post-Page `/new`

> only available, if  logged-In

Here you enter a new post. Location, Title and Date are required, the rest is optional. 

The Location-Field uses Googlemaps-Autocomplete.  

##### Step1

Entering a valid location from the list. Then the Input-Field gets locked and the following information is fetched:

###### From Googlemaps:

- 2 images. If no images are available, fallback-images are used (Try "Nuussuaq, Greenland"ðŸ˜‰). 
- The location (lat, lng)
- name & country
- Place-ID

###### From Wikipedia:

- A short desciption  (if available). The text can then be edited.

##### Step 2

Edit the Title, Date, Rating, Description and Wiki for that Post. 

- SUBMIT: stores the Blog-Post and directs back to the Main-Page.
- CANCEL: goes back to Overview without storing
- RESET LOCATION: resets the Location-Field -> back to Step 1
